Pitch Deck (If you don't get it, get on it)

## Introduction

Drawing inspiration from the widely-acclaimed literary masterpiece of the 21st century, "One Piece", we present a venture capital model that's both innovative and familiar. Like the pirates in search of the elusive 'One Piece', we're setting out on a journey. Not for treasure, but for technological advancements, specifically, AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).

We aren't pirates in the traditional sense; consider us as the rebels and punks Steve Jobs referred to, or the modern-day "privateers". We're flying the flag of ethical entrepreneurship. Our destination? The future of tech. And like every great journey, ours will be filled with challenges and alliances.

## "The One Piece - Straw Hat" - Venture Capital Model

I'm a pirate
We're pirates, if you're with me (support me), you get the idea.
[To clearify, I would want to avoid the criminal connotation... To put things in context, Steve Jobs described us as rebels, punks, and those that see the future. To avoid any potential pitfalls/hazards, I should state right now that I would be techncially sailing as a "privateer", flying under the standard of being a good ethical human being, but that doesn't sound as cool as calling myself and my crew pirates]

We're going to find the one piece
We going to fight other crews
Wer going to partner with other crews
We going to against Yonko

1) Discover the 'One Piece': This isn't a treasure but rather the potential of AGI. Our goal is to position our company to harness the power of AGI as soon as it becomes viable.
2) Combat Rivals: Just as pirates clash on the seas, we'll face competition. But it's a test of willpower, determination, and strategy.
3) Forge Alliances: Aligning with like-minded entrepreneurs and companies will strengthen our fleet. We recognize the power of strategic partnerships.
4) Challenge the 'Yonko': Established giants in the industry might have a head start, but we have the vision and determination to give them a run for their money.

[I at least on the surface level, understand the challenges of being a founder. I need to maintain the vision. There going to competition. There's also going to be stategic partnerships with other companies and VC investment firms. My crew is going up against established players]

Everyone wants to know what the One Piece is... but we're going to find it

[We're basically waiting for AGI. Build the company that best make use of AGI when it does come. Build the frame, swap out the engine, by that time if capital is still important, the AGI should be printing money]

(These roles aren't neccessy people, these are roles)
(The companies can be roles)

[I think Zuckerburg this this, give a clear view to each VC in what way they can help the organization (or pit them against each other to bid up the valuation...)]

I'm often reminded of the history of VC, it's getting money to sailers for them to go on uncertain expeditions for treasure.

I'm the captain your looking for.

## The Crew
[This is some of the architypical framework for a successful company in the modern 21st century]

Luffy - Captain
Flexibility. Visionary. Good Heart/Intentions - Ethical. Playful. It's about having fun.
	
Roronoa Zoro - First Mate
Technical Badass. Zoro's not currently the best swordman in the world but he is trying to be. Zoro keeps the crew in line when the captain is goofing off.

Nami - Navigator, "Cat Burglar", The Strategic Compass
Nami keeps the crew in line, in One Piece, it's depicted as a very female role of keeping the guys from doing too many stupid things. She's an expert navigator that always has her eyes on the prize.

Usopp - Jack-Of-All-Trades

Sanji - Cook - The Other Badass

Tony Tony Chopper - Doctor

Nico Robin - The historian - The polygraph the hidden knowledge of business - all hands person

Franky - Uncle of the Group

Brook - Old Hand - (old time vibes)

Jinbe - Veteran Expert

Nefertari Vivi - Sponsor

The Going Merry & Thousand Sunny
[We'll need to be on the lookout for platforms that are as adaptable and resilient as AWS, Azure, and GCloud. I'm personally a practioner of "serveless", in the sense that I've tried to minimize thinking about hardware challenges. Code and reliable execution of the code... Dependant on good hardware makers...]
