# Third Offset Pitch

## Getting a Piece of the Defense Budget Pie

---

Goals Stated

  - Learning machines: leveraging Artificial Intelligence and autonomy into an offset advantage; i.e., instantly responding against cyber-attacks, electronic attacks or attacks against space architecture or missiles
  
  - Human-machine collaboration: using advanced computers and visualization to help people make faster, better and more relevant decisions
  
  - Assisted human operations: plugging every pilot, soldier, sailor and Marine into the battle network
  
  - Human-machine combat teaming: creating new ways for manned and unmanned platforms to operate
  
  - Network-enabled autonomous weapons: weapons platforms and systems plugged into a learning command, control, communications and intelligence (C3I) network

Personally, I honestly ~~can care less about builing weapons~~ feel the the US military developing Combat Robotics is cool...

My personally motivations is that once the tech is available it'll desseminate out to the public
Like the internet, this AI military system, can be co-opted for public use

My personal plan is build the same thing except instead of soldiers I build homestead bots... I think one of the only true advantages that the US has is the amount of land vs population... Homestead bot will allow for the development of the land.

Should be the best alpha add to US society if the US actually want to spend all this money on this tech...
