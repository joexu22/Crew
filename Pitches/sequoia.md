Actually, a vision from my fully schizo form.
Pitch to Sequoia

The only thing I know is that trees, especially the Sequoia, tend to last a long long time - they also have a deep history.

I assume the memetic surrounding the legacy of Sequia trees bleed into the understanding of how this Sequoia Capital works

I'm reminded of some interesting concepts surrounding the sine similiariteis of pine trees - whatever that means.

So, my basic inituitive understanding is that investments should have a very long and lasting impact.

So what's the actual pitch

It's a vision of the internet.
The interconnectedness of this internet

The inspiration comes from me litterally looking at a spiderweb

The product idea is ...

Have AI look and model how spiders create their webs in the three dimensional space. Use tons of cameras tons of data collection instruments. Do the full science route on examining how spiders create their webs.

Spiders create interconnected links.

We then use our best models of how our internet is connected.
I know that google has good link/page-rank algorithms
I believe that some of the best 3d modeling of the links for the internet is something we have on hand.

The idea then is to use Machine Leanring... AI nearal nets... to make the connection from Actual Spider Webs and Internet.

The idea is that we can then use the LLM to acutally simulate the creating and modeling of 3d internet visualization by essentially telling the LLM to create the internet model as if it were actually spinning out a web.

Bascially telling a spider... I want you to spin a web that models the internet 1 for 1.

Expect this is somewhat simulated inside an LLM.

Literally a fever dream idea...
I take this somewhat seriously because it was a rather interesting fever dream for me...

If someone else is reading this. IDK... it's probably rather crazy but worth looking at
