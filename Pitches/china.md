## Digital Economics and Social Impacts

Professor Kou Zonglai
  - deputy dean of the School of Economics of Fudan University

"digital economic and social impact"
  - economic and social impact of digitalization from three aspects
    - organizational boundaries
    - industrial dynamics
    - basic social contradictions

Professor Kou Zonglai pointed out that digitalization is a general technology that will integrate many small markets that were originally scattered in the sense of information into a large market, thus changing the division of labor model, reducing the cost of coordination, and will have a profound impact on industrial dynamics, industrial boundaries, basic social contradictions, and national comparative advantages. In the process of changing the digital economy, Schumpeter's effect may become stronger and stronger, and conversely, for everyone, it may be replaced if it is not updated at any time. In this regard, academic research also needs to be innovative in theoretical research and empirical research, data-intensive research, etc.


## Algorithm Balance in Digital Economy

Professor Deng Xiaotie, Chair Professor of Frontier Computing Research Center of Peking University, Director of Multi-agent Center of Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Peking University, and Director of CCF Computing Economics Professional Group, shared his research experience and experience with the theme of "Algorithm Balance in Digital Economy". Professor Deng Xiaotie shared that pricing and resource allocation in the study of economics is an important content. Today's era is the era of algorithms. Algorithmic equilibrium and computable economics provide a feasible path for solving the main game in the era of digital economy.


## Macro Meaning of the Digital Economy (Big Picture)

Peng Wensheng, executive president of CICC Research Institute and chief economist of CICC, explained in detail the theme of "the macro meaning of the digital economy". He pointed out that the digital economy has brought new economic growth points, as well as new challenges and problems. The digital economy enhances the scale advantage of major countries and affects income distribution and market competition models. Public policies need to promote the establishment of a better market ecology from the aspects of encouraging innovative competition, grasping the supply-side and demand-side relationship, and improving the financial structure. In the digital era, the development of the digital economy and digital industry promoted by the effect of economies of scale may have more important macro meanings, and the changes in income distribution in this process are the issues we should pay more attention to.

## Consumer Welfare of Commodity Diversity

  - President of Luo Hantang

"Consumer Welfare of Commodity Diversity"
  - changes in the relationship between producers and consumers
  - diversity growth in promoting consumer value
  - commodity diversity is the core of the classic economic growth theory
  - era of cognitive diversification and increasing supply
    - consumers have become more and more important
  - digital technology has greatly reduced the limitation of physical distance
  - rapid development of digital platforms has further released the potential value of diversity growth

## Internet development and governance system construction in the Web3.0 era"

Professor Feng Gengzhong, dean of the School of Management of Xi'an Jiaotong University, focused on the problem of "Internet development and governance system construction in the Web3.0 era". Professor Feng Gengzhong pointed out that in the Web3.0 era, the risks of the technical system and the risks of the social application system have put forward higher requirements for governance innovation. Please. We should strengthen the construction of the blockchain discipline, especially to deeply explore some inherent laws in the development and application of technology. Only when the understanding of the laws is in-depth, can there be corresponding management measures. The technical application of blockchain, including the scenario of Web3.0, is a multidisciplinary application scenario. There are many problems in management disciplines and scientific and technological supervision that are worth studying. At the same time, computer science should also further solve the basic technical problems of blockchain, such as solving theoretical and technical problems such as delivery blockchain systems, visual analysis, high-dynamic heterogeneous social networks, theories and algorithms.


## Information Economic

Professor Li Sanxi of Renmin University of China interpreted the digital economy from the perspective of information economics, and analyzed how the digital economy brings challenges to the discipline of information economics from the perspective of disciplines. Professor Li Sanxi pointed out that the existence of search and matching costs and information asymmetry are the main factors in information economics that are considered to affect the efficiency of economic operation.

In the digital era, the online reputation mechanism, big data analysis, blockchain technology, etc. have weakened the above two limiting factors to a certain extent; but at the same time Issues such as information monopoly, data manipulation, and disputes over personalized welfare effects have brought great challenges to the development of the digital economy, which has also promoted the transformation of information economics from mechanism design research to information rule design research.

# Discussions

In the second part of the conference, "Economic Development and Discipline Construction in the Digital Age", under the chairmanship of Professor An Tongliang, Dean of the Business School of Nanjing University and Dean of the School of Digital Economy and Management, Professor Zhu Yan, Dean of Tsinghua Internet Industry Research Institute, Professor Song Hua, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Business School of Renmin University of China, Professor Wang Yong, Deputy Director of the Institute of Economics of the Tsinghua Academy of Social Sciences, Professor Li Li Xing of the National Development Research Institute of Peking University, Professor Shi Bingzhan of the School of Economics of Nankai University, Associate Professor Xie Danxia of the Institute of Economics of the Tsinghua Academy of Social Sciences, Liu Chu of the Strategic Development Department of CICC and other experts spoke and heated discussions on relevant topics one after another.


Development of the digital economy has reached a critical period of theoretical innovation in China. The Internet Industry Research Institute is committed to the research of digital economy and industrial transformation and regional industrial transformation. The accumulation of practice over the past 40 years has provided a rich research space. I hope that through this meeting, we can make concerted efforts and give full play to our research strength to break through the key paths and key issues in the study of digital economy theory.

Professor Song Hua said that digital technology and supply chain finance are an important part of digital economy research, involving many financial Fintech issues. Practice is ahead of theoretical research, leaving us with many topics to continue to explore theoretically.

Professor Wang Yong pointed out that the platform economy is the core and most important place of the digital economy, and a large number of digital economic activities are carried out on the platform. The cross-network effect depicts the positive feedback mechanism in the bilateral market, and is also the concentrated embodiment of the scale effect of the platform economy. Only by deeply understanding the essential characteristics of the platform economy and combining it from the perspective of population advantages, flow economy, attention resources, etc., can we more effectively carry out platform governance and promote the development of the platform economy.

Associate Professor Xie Danxia said that knowledge innovation based on data elements provides new content for endogenous growth theory. The low privacy cost of knowledge makes it extremely valuable, which is a very important innovation point under the framework of endogenous growth theory, so that data elements may have an impact on long-term economic growth analysis and dynamic non-competitive analysis.

## Data Questions

Professor Shi Bingzhan

pointed out whether data, a special resource, is still constrained by geographical location in the era of digital economy. Invisible and ubiquitous, where is it ubiquitous? If data, as the core resource of numbers, is affected by geography and culture, we believe that the inequality caused by previous rounds of globalization or economic growth will still exist in the future and may be strengthened.

## Open Source Systems

Liu Chu

  - unclear current returns and long-term benefits
  - traditional economic analysis framework is not well explained.

Its own research found that the investment of small and medium-sized enterprises in open source technology innovation is mainly to effectively improve their market competitiveness through the network effect, but there is still room for research for individual developers and large enterprises to invest in open source research and development.

In addition, the open source system has brought new changes to the industrial field. For example, the open source technology research and development model provides a new socialized form of industrial organization, which is a new way of resource allocation between enterprises and the market.

Open source technology allows enterprises to quickly and low-cost vertical integration and achieve scope economy.

He stressed that today, with such a wide range of applications of open source, there are still some new phenomena that need to be researched and supported by theoretical innovation in economics and management to guide practice.
