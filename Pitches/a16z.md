It seems inane that there are better video games than tools of democracy. As someone who participated in the Gamestop hype, I'm disappointed they didn't build a platform, it's looking like a grift at this point. I'm not about that. Power to the Player! - but acutally do it.

One idea is to build a knowledge based skill tree similiar to Path of Exile or Diablo

Education can be transformed as actual skill tree.
Think DuoLingo/KhanAcademy - with the interface and engagement of a popular video game (LoL, Diablo, etc)

Really just need to attract the talent to build it

As a founder it's really up to me to build the Proof Of Concept with hacked together tools - get the vision across with the tools available

Afterwards - we need to bring in the big guns math/physics/engineering to build things up from first principle
