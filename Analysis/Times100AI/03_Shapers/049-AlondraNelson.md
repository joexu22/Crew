Nelson came to White House with a knockout résumé: 
professor at Columbia and Yale
president and CEO of the nonprofit Social Science Research Council
author of several acclaimed books on genetics, race, and medical discrimination.

She brought the same rigor and attention to detail to the AI blueprint, which she formulated over the course of a year, with she and her team talking extensively with industry players, academics, high school students, and teachers. From those conversations, she identified a collection of best practices for industry players, including red teaming—stress-testing AI systems before they are publicly deployed—and continual audits.

These best practices, Nelson says, are all oriented toward making sure that AI actually serves the public as opposed to just being a boon for an eager tech industry. “The bottom line for the President is, how does this help families? How does this heal people?” she says. “Is this providing economic security and other forms of security for the American public? Is it helping people keep or gain jobs that are good and meaningful?”
