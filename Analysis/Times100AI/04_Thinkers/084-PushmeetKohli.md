  - Responsible and Reliable AI team
    - safety

Kohli grew up in Dehradun, India, in the foothills of the Himalayas, and moved to the U.K. to study. He spent nearly 11 years at Microsoft, where he was ultimately director of research in its Cognition Group, which aimed to build AI systems that could carry out almost all of the types of tasks that humans can do. He joined DeepMind in 2017 and soon set up the Safe and Reliable AI team, which later changed its name. (DeepMind merged with a division of Google in April to become Google DeepMind.) Kohli says Shane Legg, co-founder and chief AGI, or artificial general intelligence, scientist at DeepMind, had been working on safety “from day zero,” but his team tries to address the “safety issues that come with deployment of ML [machine learning] models in the near term.”

Kohli refuses to pick a favorite between the two teams he leads, but his eyes light up when he discusses the work of AI for Science. AlphaFold, the team’s greatest success so far, has been used by over 1 million researchers, and can predict the structures of proteins from their amino-acid structure in seconds, a task that previously took months or years. Better understanding of protein structures will accelerate drug discovery and may pave the way for further scientific breakthroughs.
