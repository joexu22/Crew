  - Yi was inspired. “This is what I wanted to [do with my] life. That is, to build a robot that can love the human species,” he tells TIME, speaking from the Chinese capital. Yi, 41, has spent his career in Beijing as a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences trying to build “brain-inspired intelligence”—AI systems designed to be as similar as possible to human brains—in the hope that they would have a sense of morality.

Around 2016, Yi became more concerned about risks posed by AI systems, and he began to spend more of his time working with policymakers to develop rules for beneficial AI development. Three years later, Yi directed the team that wrote the Beijing AI Principles. He tells TIME he is “highly involved in policymaking through national governance committees.”

Yi also pushes for greater international cooperation. “I feel it’s my duty to let the world know that scientists and policymakers from China are really having similar ideas,” he says. He helped develop UNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, is involved in a number of informal, unofficial diplomacy initiatives, like the International Workshop on Cross-Cultural AI Ethics and Governance, and recently addressed a meeting of the U.N. Security Council.

## Tense Geopolitical Climate

- China & U.S.
  - Personal Alpha (again as a ethnically Chinese person, it'd be fking stupid not to leverage this)
    - starting to think this could be a conspiracy theory by industrialist to keep their monoploy
- AI Risks
  - "We don't really have a choice"
  - "We must collaborate"

## AI uses

- mass surveillance tech
- persecution of minorities
  - curious if there something there to be said about China's ethnic minoriites
  - woke (trans issues)

## AI Concern

- people who are for
- people who are against
  - is it a balance?
    - as in does policy and money flow be affected by the balance of this
- Questions about Polling?
  - Trump seems to like it
