Me thinking about practical AI product...
This is me thinking after goign through the 25 Leaders...

--- Making Money

--- Ethical Concerns

The first thought that I have to grapple with as an inspiring entrepreneur is weighing the balance between Making Money and Ethical Consideration...

Is there a way to make money the right way.
I remember some quotes by Naval (was it, not sure his name) that said that making money can be ethical and lots of money can be made by doing things the right way ethically.
I believe that...

The thing that sparked this line of reasoning was Scale AI...
Where concerns about hiring data-labelers for less than a $1

One of reasons why the US is such a desirable place to live is the ability to leverage the dollar...

Using the Dollar (while it's still functional)

Some Machine Generated Ideas

There are opportunities to make money ethically by focusing on enterprise solutions and business-to-business products. Providing AI capabilities and compute resources to other companies can be very lucrative.

Leveraging cheap global labor for data labeling and other repetitive tasks raises ethical concerns, but seems to be a major driver of success for some AI companies. This should be carefully evaluated.

Video games and computer graphics are a major arena where AI talent has been nurtured. The skills developed there have applications across AI.

Partnerships between academia, research labs, government agencies and companies are important for pushing AI forward. There are opportunities to bridge these groups.

Applications of AI that improve human productivity and wellbeing, like better healthcare, education and assistants, are ripe for development. The market and ethical case aligns.

Geopolitical impacts of AI leadership should be considered. There may be opportunities in strengthening US technological capabilities in areas like chips and computing.

It's important to develop AI that is kind, compassionate and aligned with human values. Products should be designed thoughtfully with ethics in mind.

Machine Generated Business Plan:

It looks like the LLMs are trying to force me into grad school... which could be a good idea if I use the oppurtunity to connect with various Research Labs and Companies during that time to launch a business...
This is more or less being the middle man of AI
Which I guess should work out until AGI robotics come out... In which case I'll pivot to the thing that acutally going to matter which is "AI assisted Homesteading" - Land Development
