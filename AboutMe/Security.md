We are in the East Blue right now.

[It's relatively easy right now, "we are" preparing ourselves for when the serious tech comes]

[The plan is the prepare for AGI ]

No one's going to take us seriously at the moment.

It's going to be a video game company.

We make fun things for our Clients, our Friends, and everyone Else.

If they steal it, we get to play with it.

The tech itself is beneficial AGI compute or something that benefits the world.

## AI Safety

History has a history of going background. Middle ages. Book burning. Average life-span lowering. Wars. Death. Suffering.

There is no guarantee that civilization will advance. We do have a responsibility to maintain or advance.

This runs into the analysis paralysis. The human spirit is creative, it's manic, it's depressive, but it's meant to explore. When it meets something greater it melds and dances and create more. It's spiritual not intellectual.

There is no battle between human vs AI. It's a dance. It's sex. [groping towards AI lolz], A melding of the consciousness. Connecting.

Young people want to build. We as older folks have understand that we have to enable the next generation. We have to understand that the younger generation will eventually get better than us as we wane (though I'm hopeful of longevity tech) and we have to have the wisdom that we had to cede our place. It's true of people and it's true of AI.

Goal to action mapper is not going to happen because of love. The best argument is love. When we create the system that can attain any goal. Love is going to prevail (The is the Truth of humanity). Purely spiritual answer... (Mathematical Proof For Love is AI Alignment)

Ying/Yang argument for AI Alignment. There is always a balance. 

We are benevolent pirates.

Everyone would love having a kid smarter than them. The kids not going to kill the if you raise it right. We'll build it right.
