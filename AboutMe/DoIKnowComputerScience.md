# Computer Science Stuff

## Do I know Computer Science? AKA do I have any street cred?

Probably not ... but ...

I think I know my discrete mathematics

I remember setting up Arch Linux and taking a class on Operating Systems, I know a little bit about how computers work

I took a programming languages class, I know my variable scoping rules and managing environments... basically I can claim to have glossed through SICP
  
  - I kinda get the joke about the "Y Combinator" and the "Y Combinator" startup incubator

I pretty sure I know something about the Turning Machine and the Halting Problem, Church-Turing Thesis, and the Lambda Calculus...
  
  - Me being a serverless guy I actually get the joke about Lambda Functions
